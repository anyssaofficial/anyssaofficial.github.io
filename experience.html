    <h3>PRIMARY SCHOOL</h3>
    <p>My Primary school was a good moments to remember. School days are the most pleasureable gift that are 
        directly gifted by god to every human. The most unforgetful moments in my primary school is,
        I joined a martials art (silat) and I represent Malacca for the competition.

    <h3>SECONDARY SCHOOL</h3>
    <p>I can never forget those school trips. It really didn't matter where you are going, the best part 
        about the school trip was the bus ride. Me and my friends used to sing many songs so loudly on the 
        bus during school trips. Literally, I wish that I could go back to school days and enjoy it again.
